# EMP Open Source Wiki

## About This Wiki

This wiki is a continuously updated knowledge base for EMP Open Source. It explains how the system works, how to use it, and why it exists — clearly, practically, and without marketing fluff.

The documentation is written with a skeptical, engineering-first mindset. Assumptions are questioned, trade-offs are documented, and limitations are stated openly. Accuracy matters more than completeness, and this wiki is expected to evolve alongside the codebase.
