# Employee Management Portal

EMP (Employee Management Portal) is a modular employee management system designed to handle core employee operations in a straightforward, self-hostable way—ensuring that work, responsibilities, and outcomes are clearly recorded and do not get lost over time.

EMP Open Source represents the core, single-instance version of the EMP platform. It is intended for teams and organizations that want full control over their HR system without relying on cloud-only services or proprietary dependencies.

EMP focuses on operational clarity rather than feature sprawl.
