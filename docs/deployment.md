# Deployment

EMP Open Source is designed to be deployed as a single-tenant application.

## Typical deployment flow

1. Configure environment variables
2. Initialize the database
3. Apply schema migrations
4. Start application services

Production scaling and high-availability strategies are outside the scope of the open-source core.
